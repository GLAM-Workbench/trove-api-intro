    "There's another couple of peculiarities that you need to be aware of. The first is really more of an annoyance than a peculiarity. As you might have noticed above, to find the results for the 'people'zone I had to loop through all the zones until I found the one with the name 'people'. We can't just say, 'give me the people results!'. Of course, this is only an issue if you've asked for results from more than one zone. If you set the 'zone' parameter to a single zone – like 'newspaper' – the newspaper data would be the first (and only) set of results. You could find them at  `data['response']['zone'][0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also have noticed that the individual records from the 'people' zone were found at `zone['records']['people']`. What's wrong with that? Well, it means that different zones use different keys to identify their records. So you have to know in advance what the key is in order to get the records data. Again, if you're only working with one zone it's not too hard. But if you're working across multiple zones, it's a bit of a pain.\n",
